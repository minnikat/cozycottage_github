    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
    Our story begins like many others. A person with a dream and the determination to make it a reality. A young girl that spent her childhood engrossed in the stories she read and watched, stories that stayed with her well into adulthood.
    </p>
    <p>  
    Together, they wanted to bring their passions to their community, to share what they loved with like-minded individuals. This came in the form of <em>The Cozy Cottage Bed and Breakfast</em>, where all weary travelers are welcome to prop their feet up, and enjoy the atmosphere.

    <h1>Our Location</h1>
    <p>
     We are located in the beautiful town of <em>Town, USA</em>, right in between two national parks. Just a hiking distance away you can find enchanting forests, whimsical waterfalls and relaxing rivers. We hope these attractions help our guests reconnect with nature, and stimulate their imaginations. What creatures could they find wandering the woods? What treasures could they uncover? We wish for our guests to have many adventures here, or to just stay in bed and enjoy the view.
